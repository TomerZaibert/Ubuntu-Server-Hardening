# Web Server Security Hardening

In this project, I worked on securing a web server by setting up and configuring LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) while applying key security best practices. This included hardening SSH access, configuring the firewall, and securing the database to reduce potential attack vectors. The goal was to create a more resilient server setup that follows industry best practices.
