# Web Server Security Hardening

This project focuses on securing a web server by installing and configuring LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) while implementing security best practices such as firewall configuration, SSH hardening, and database security. The setup follows a structured approach to minimize attack vectors and ensure the server is resilient against common threats.
